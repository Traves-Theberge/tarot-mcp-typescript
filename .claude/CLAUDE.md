## Formatting

- In general, always add a newline to the ends of files after the last line of content. The last line of any file you generate should be an empty line. Put another way, the last character of every file should be `\n`.

### Swift

- Always include an empty line between import statements and the rest of the content.
- Always remove leading whitespace from empty lines. Empty lines should not include any horizontal whitespace, ever.

### Markdown

- Always include an empty line between headers and other content.
